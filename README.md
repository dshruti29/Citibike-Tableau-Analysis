CitiBike first launched in 2013 and has since become an important fixture of New York Cityâ€™s transportation landscape. Citi Bike is a docked bike share system, consisting of a fleet of traditional and electric bikes and a network of stations throughout the city. Multiple payment options available to riders include single-trip purchases, day passes, and annual memberships, with prices varying based on bike type, trip duration, and membership status. Citi Bike is available for use 24 hours per day, 365 days out of the year, with bikes and stations 
located throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Jersey City.

Lyft issues performance reports on a monthly basis that aggregate data over a 30-day period. Although more detailed real-time performance and service data are available via the Generalized Bike Share Feed Specification (GBFS) format(below), this dataset cannot be easily viewed or analyzed without advanced data processing skills .
